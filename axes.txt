📑 Project Report Outline: Build Master
I. Project Overview & Vision
1.1 Executive Summary: High-level project goal.
1.2 The "Build Master" Concept: Solving the complexity of PC building.
1.3 Core Objectives: Technical goals vs. Methodology goals (Demonstrating DevOps/Scrum).
II. Agile Methodology: The Scrum Framework
2.0 Team Roles & Organization: (Based on your 
teamstructure.txt)
Frontend vs Backend breakdown.
2.1 Product Backlog & User Stories: How requirements were transformed into actionable tasks.
2.2 Sprint Management:
Planning, Daily Scrums, and Retrospectives.
2.3 Collaboration Tools: Trello/Jira, GitHub Projects, and Slack/Discord usage.
III. Functional Analysis & Design
3.1 System Architecture: High-level diagram of Vue <-> Express <-> PostgreSQL.
3.2 Database Modeling: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) explaining the component relationships.
3.3 The Core Logic (PC Builder): How we implemented the step-by-step compatibility engine (Socket, TDP, RAM types).
3.4 AI Integration: The Chatbot workflow (NLP for hardware recommendations).
IV. Technical Implementation (The Stack)
4.1 Frontend Architecture: Vue 3 Ecosystem (Composition API, Pinia, Tailwind CSS).
4.2 Backend Architecture: Robust API design with Express & Prisma ORM.
4.3 Security Implementation: JWT handling, bcrypt hashing, and Role-Based Access Control (Admin vs User).
V. The DevOps Cycle: From Code to Cloud
5.1 Version Control Strategy: GitFlow/Branching strategy used by the team.
5.2 Integration & Environment Management:
Development vs. Production environments.
5.3 Automation (CI/CD):
Vercel Pipeline: Frontend auto-deployment.
Render Pipeline: Backend builds and Prisma generation.
5.4 Database as a Service (DBaaS): Managed Postgres on Supabase.
VI. Testing & Quality Assurance
6.1 API Testing: Postman/Thunder Client collections.
6.2 Code Quality: Linting, formatting, and structure normalization.
6.3 Performance & Optimization: "Spin-down" management and asset optimization (Cloudinary).
VII. Results, Challenges & Conclusion
7.1 Deployment Results: Links to live environments.
7.2 Overcoming Obstacles: (e.g., Switching from GCP to Vercel/Render, handling monorepo deployments).
7.3 Final Evaluation: Did we meet the original "Cahier de Charges"?
7.4 Future Perspectives: Scaling the store and deeper AI logic.
